The mobile version of **I Heard A Rumor (IHAR)** brings the same anonymous social sharing experience to smartphones using **Flutter**. Users can post rumors as text or images, interact through comments and upvotes, and enjoy a seamless onboarding process with **Google login** or stay **anonymous**.

Built with modern mobile-first features, the app includes:

- Google login and anonymous access  
- Posting rumors via text or image  
- Deep link support for sharing content  
- Push notifications  
- Flutter BLoC for state management  
- Smooth UI & UX transitions and navigation

This personal project demonstrates my ability to deliver full-featured Flutter apps with real-time integrations and secure, scalable backend.
