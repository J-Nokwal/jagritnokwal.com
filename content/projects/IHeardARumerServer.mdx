This project is the backend infrastructure behind [I Heard A Rumor](/projects/IHeardARumerApp), built using **Go** with **Gin** and **GORM**, and deployed on **DigitalOcean**. It powers both the mobile and web versions of IHAR.

Key features include:

- Google Authentication and Admin login  
- JWT-based secure authentication  
- Middleware for authorization and validation  
- Notification service integration  
- Image uploads handled via **Firebase Storage**  
- MySQL as the relational database

This backend ensures the system is scalable, secure, and easy to maintain with modular routes, structured handlers, and RESTful API design.
