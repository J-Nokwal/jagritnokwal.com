ChitraGupta is a unified portal developed during **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2022** by a team of five. The platform is designed for students to seamlessly connect with:

- Government services and schemes  
- College and academic updates  
- And more academic utilities in a centralized manner  

The idea behind the portal is similar to [APAAR](https://apaar.education.gov.in/) – **Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry** – where students have a unified identity and access to educational resources.

The project qualified the college round and was listed on the **pre-screening results** in SIH 2022.

**Key Features:**

- Single portal to access multiple student-related services
- Government scheme integration
- College notification and update system
- Unified academic identity approach
