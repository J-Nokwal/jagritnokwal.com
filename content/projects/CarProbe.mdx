</div>
The tool includes the following features:


- Create a new lead for a car
- Schedule a date for the car inspection
- Set reminders for upcoming inspections
- Perform a full scan through an OBD scanner connected via Bluetooth
- Capture photos of all aspects of the car
- Conclude the lead
- View previous leads
- Offline use

This tool was integral in streamlining the car inspection process for sellers, making it easier to manage multiple leads and ensure thorough inspections. By integrating OBD scanning and photo capture, Car Probe provided inspectors with a comprehensive view of each vehicle's condition, ultimately helping car owners get accurate evaluations before selling.
