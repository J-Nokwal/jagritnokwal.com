**Guess the Logo** is a real-time multiplayer quiz game developed using **Golang** and **gRPC** (HTTP/2 protocol). The game revolves around identifying brands from either their logos or names, offering an engaging and competitive experience.

Players are presented with:

- A **brand name** and must choose the correct **logo** out of four.
- Or, a **logo** and must choose the correct **brand name** out of four.

Game modes:
- ðŸŸ¢ Easy  
- ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
- ðŸ”´ Hard  
Each level reduces the time available to select an answer, increasing difficulty.

**Key features:**

- Entirely **server-controlled**: client apps only render screens and handle basic navigation.
- **gRPC protocol** for real-time communication.
- Server sends commands like:  
  â†’ `show_scoreboard`  
  â†’ `next_question`  
  â†’ `end_game`  
- All logic lives on the server; clients just follow instructions.
- Scoreboard and user data saved in a **MySQL** database.
- Logo dataset sourced from **Kaggle**.
