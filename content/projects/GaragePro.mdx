During my internship at CaRPM (from August 1, 2021, to January 31, 2022), I worked on several projects, including [Car Probe](/projects/carProbe) and Garage Pro.

Garage Pro is an app designed for vehicle owners to perform comprehensive scans on their vehicles via an OBD device. The app offers a wide range of features including:

- Full scan
- Clearing codes
- Live data monitoring
- Track mode
- Special functions
- Multi-language reports
- Error responses with suggested actions

**My Role:**  
In this project, my primary focus was on integrating localization to support eight different languages, both global and Indian. I also played a critical role in ensuring the app's security by reverse-engineering the app to extract command data, analyzing new security tools, and recommending enhancements to the team. Additionally, I worked on improving the appâ€™s first install loading screen speed. All these tasks were accomplished on iOS using Flutter.
