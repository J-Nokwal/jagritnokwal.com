**About:**  
During my internship at Zymbia Interactive Technologies (CaRPM), I developed Garagebook, an app designed to streamline job management, accounting, customer relations, and inventory control for garage owners. The project involved gathering requirements, analyzing competitors, and then developing and iterating on the app based on user feedback. The initial UI was integrated with backend services, and through multiple version releases—each incorporating new features like inventory management, in-app purchases, and WhatsApp direct share—the app evolved to meet the needs of garage owners more effectively.

**My Role & Responsibilities:**  
- Designed and developed the initial UI and integrated it with backend services.
- Implemented key features including inventory management, job card galleries, and in-app purchases.
- Ensured seamless user experience through localization and offline capabilities.
- Integrated Firebase for analytics and notifications.
- Managed project tasks and progress using Jira.
- Maintained and collaborated on the codebase using Bitbucket.
- Iteratively improved the app based on feedback from beta testers and users.
