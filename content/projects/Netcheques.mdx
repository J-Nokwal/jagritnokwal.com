Netcheques is a mobile application developed during the HackTU Hackathon at Thapar University, Patiala on February 26, 2021. Built by a team of four, the project aimed to provide a seamless financial transaction experience **without requiring internet connectivity**.

The app functioned similarly to a debit card, where users could enter a PIN on the merchantâ€™s device to authorize transactions. All transactions used **QR codes** for quick and secure communication between devices.

Although the project remained incomplete, it demonstrated a powerful proof-of-concept that leveraged **serverless architecture** and **mobile-first design** for robust financial operations.

**Key Features:**

- Works without internet connectivity
- QR code-based transactions
- PIN-based authentication
- Simulates a debit card-like experience
